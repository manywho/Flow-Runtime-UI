# ManyWho UI Core

Core JavaScript services used by the [Boomi Flow](https://boomi.com/flow/) UI framework to do the heavy lifting.

API docs ui-core are generated by the excellent [Typedoc](http://typedoc.org/) and can be found [here](https://manywho.github.io/ui-core)

## Running

First install dependencies with `npm install` then

```
webpack
``` 

Which will start the webpack dev server and re-compile the typescript on changes.

By default the compiled assets will be output to the `build` folder, you can override this using the `--build` arg:

```
webpack --build="custom-folder"
```
