# ManyWho UI Core

Core JavaScript services used by the [ManyWho](https://manywho.com) UI framework to do the heavy lifting.

## Running

First install dependencies with `npm install` then

```
webpack
``` 

Which will start the webpack dev server and re-compile the typescript on changes.

By default the compiled assets will be output to the `build` folder, you can override this using the `--build` arg:

```
webpack --build="custom-folder"
```
